             Unsigned Int org.xfce.Session.Client.GetState()

             Queries the session manager for a client's state.
             Valid states are:
                 0  Idle: the client is operating normally.
                 1  Interacting: the client is interacting with the
                    user as part of the shutdown process.
                 2  Save Done: the client has finished saving its state.
                 3  Saving: the client is saving its state.
                 4  Saving Local: the client is saving its local state
                    (as opposed to global state).
                 5  Wait for Interact: the client is waiting for the
                    session manager to allow it to interact with the
                    user.
                 6  Wait for Phase 2: the client is waiting for the
                    session manager to enter Phase 2 so it can continue
                    saving its state.
                 7  Disconnected: the client has disconnected from the
                    session mananger (depending on its restart style,
                    it may still remain in the session after
                    disconnecting).

                          keys and variant values.

             Sets properties specified in the hash array.  Other
             properties are not affected.

             Implementation note: properties may be validated in

             indicate that some properties have been set, but
             others have not.

             Implementation note: Some properties defined in the
             XSMP spec have defined semantics and default values.
             This properties may not actually be deleted, but simply
             reset to their default values.

             void org.xfce.Session.Client.Terminate()

             Instructs the client to exit.  Whether or not the client
             remains in the session depends on its restart hint
             SM property.  If the restart hint is RestartImmediately,
             the client will likely indeed be restarted immediately.

             To actually remove a running client from the running
             session, it's best to set the restart hint SM property
             to RestartIfRunning before calling Terminate.

             (resulting in a SmPropertyChanged signal instead).
