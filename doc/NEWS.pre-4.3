20040924:
---------

	* Version 4.1.16
	* Don't grab the display on logout, as it doesn't work well with
	  compositors.

20040203:
---------

	* Version 4.1.2
	* Icon changes in the tray icon menu (the session control icon)
	* Added about dialog now that XfceAboutDialog is in libxfcegui4.

20040129:
---------

	* Version 4.1.1 (big jump indeed, but need to catch up with the rest
	  of the desktop :-))
	* Finally moved xfce_setenv()/xfce_putenv() to libxfce4util and
	  we are now secured from stupid native implementations of both
	  functions.
	* Some autotools and copyright updates.

20040125:
---------
	* Version 0.2.1
	* Updated the xfce4-session manual page to reflect the latest
	  changes.

20040113:
---------
	* Added --disable-tcp option to disable binding to TCP ports. This
	  is no new configure option, but a runtime option, that is, it can
	  be supplied to xfce4-session at startup.

20040110:
---------
	* Version 0.2.0
	* Added support for user defined poweroff/halt/reboot commands,
	  and some cleanups, thanks to Brian Tarricone.
	* Various fixes in the meantime, too bad I have no spare time for
	  xfce :-(

20030721:
---------
	* Fix problem with Xrandr MCS plugin and splash screen not using
	  the new screen height/width.

20030716:
---------
	* XfceTrayIcon now both provides "clicked" (a single left button
	  click) and "double_clicked" (double left button click) signals
	* XfceTrayIcon no longer autoconnects, you'll need to call
	  xfce_tray_icon_connect() explicitly

20030715:
---------
	* Version 0.1.1
	* Make "session control" sticky again, since the xfwm4 problem with
	  sticky windows seems to be fixed
	* Many improvements on the XfceTrayIcon class (will be moved to
	  libxfcegui4 soon)
	* Session managers tray icon can now be enabled/disabled from
	  the settings dialog
	* Added more helpful tooltips to the settings dialog (translations
	  needs to be updated)

20030713:
---------
	* Version 0.1.0
	* Fixed problem with SaveYourself Phase2 being aborted (that
	  should also correct the xfwm4 save problem).
	* Fixed problem with "session control" window beeing undecorated
	* Fix problem with users splash themes directory not being created
	  when installing new themes
	* Skip the splash screen window in tasklists and pagers (Gdk >= 2.2
	  only for now, a netk version is on the way, see util.c)

20030712:
---------
	* Fixed tray icon problem
	* New tray icon wrapper XfceTrayIcon, will be moved to libxfcegui4
	  later

20030710:
---------
	* Added spec file
	* Two Solaris fixes
	* State is now displayed in "session control"
	* added "Quit session" and "Save session" to the tray menu
	  (GtkImageMenuItem's now working btw.)
	* Fixed bug in SaveYourselfDone code (manager does not entered
	  IDLE state after a succesfull checkpoint)
	* Added UNIX signals support: SIGUSR1 saves current session, SIGINT
	  quits current session
	* Added security check to xfce4-shutdown (shutdown.allow is only used
	  if owned by root)
	* Honor fast SaveYourself requests

20030708:
---------
	* startxfce4 in xfce-utils was altered to automatically use
	  xfce4-session by default if installed.
	* Added "session control" dialog and tray icon. Made several
	  improvements. Now requires libxfcegui4 >= 3.92.2
	* smproxy now works with xfce4-session, that says, X11R5 session
	  apps are now managed by the session manager as well (e.g. xcalc,
	  xedit, xbiff or even apps like gimp and gqview)

20030707:
---------
	* Splash screen themes can now be selected from the settings plugin,
	  and in addition, you can also install new themes from the settings
	  plugin.
	* Added docs/FAQ file.

20030706:
---------
	* the session manager now takes care of starting files in
	  ~/Desktop/Autostart/ after all session aware apps are restarted.
	  This should make live easier, esp. with apps that depend on
	  the window manager already running.
	* the splash screen is now themable. See docs/SplashThemes.txt for
	  further information. In addition, the splash screen also appears
	  when starting a default session, and not only when restoring a
	  previously saved session.

20030702:
---------
	* session file naming scheme has changed from
		~/.xfce4/sessions/session-<hostname>
	  to
		~/.xfce4/sessions/xfsm-<hostname>
